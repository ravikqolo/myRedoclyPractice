## Create Card

Card can be created on Qolo platform using [&#39;Create Card&#39; API](https://devapi.qolopay.com/index.html#operation/CreateCard). Clients must provide the Person details in the API.

1. _For an existing Person on Qolo Platform:_ Clients must provide the Person GUID in the Create Card API.
2. _For a new/unregistered Person:_ Clients must provide the entire Person object in the Create Card API. The API end point creates a Person (as cardholder) with a wallet, account and a card, and associates the card to the Person&#39;s wallet.

Some programs may have a limitation on Card creation based on the cardholder (Person) verification status. For such programs, Card creation may be altogether denied; or restricted to a limited capability card for unverified cardholders (Persons).
