# Program Funding Account

A Program Funding Account (also called a Master Funding Account) is a Qolo account created for clients to fund (or load) an individual Person account (or card). The Program Funding Account is created in the name of the client.

Any transfer request by the client to add funds to an individual&#39;s account (or card) results in a corresponding debit to client funding account. The Program Funding Account must therefore be sufficiently funded by the client to cover any such transfer requests. Clients can fund the account by sending wire or ACH to a designated bank account shared by Qolo. [API Refernce](https://devapi.qolopay.com/index.html#operation/CreateAccount)
