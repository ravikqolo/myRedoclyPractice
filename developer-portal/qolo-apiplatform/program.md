# Program

A Program on Qolo platform that encapsulates all the client specific requirements pertaining to their application. It defines the platform components and their interactions with each other; and all the associated features, capabilities, processes, rules and fees.

For example, a Program would define whether one or more wallets, accounts or cards can be created for a person. A Program would also define the card forms that can be issued (plastic, virtual or tokenized), or applicable account currencies, and so on.

Qolo professionals work with Clients to define the program that suits the client needs and their application requirements. After a Program is setup on Qolo platform, Program GUID(s) is/are shared with the client to be used in the API requests.
