## Card Lost, Stolen or Damaged - Replace &amp; Reissue Cards

If a cardholder loses access to their card, or their card stops functioning; a new card must be issued to the cardholder.

1. If the card is lost or stolen, the original card must be moved to &#39;Lost&#39; or &#39;Stolen&#39; status and a new card must be issued with a new PAN / Card number. This is referred to as &#39;Card Replacement&#39;.
2. If the card is damaged or has stopped functioning, the original card must be moved to &#39;Damaged&#39; status, and a new card must be issued with the same PAN / Card number. This is referred to as &#39;Card Reissuance&#39;.

P.S. A replacement or reissued card still accesses the same account as the original card. Therefore, no fund transfer is required for the replacement or reissued card.
