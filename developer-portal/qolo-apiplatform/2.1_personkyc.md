## Person Verification / KYC

Regulations such as the Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering law (BSA/AML) require Qolo to form a reasonable confidence on the identity of each customer. This is required to control suspicious and/or fraudulent activity on the platform.

Some Programs require Persons to be verified before opening their account, or giving them access to certain functions. To perform a Person Verification, Qolo requires the following information:

1.
### For Natural Persons

- Legal name (first and last name);
- Complete residential address;
- Official government ID and the ID type.
- Date and place of birth.

1.
### For Legal Persons (Currently handled offline)

- Name, legal form, status and proof of incorporation of the legal person;
- Permanent address of the principal place of the legal person&#39;s activities;
- Official identification number (company registration number, tax identification number);
- Mailing and registered address of legal person;
- License or legal opinion from a law firm located in each country where business activity will occur or be offered to cardholders.
- Any other documents to complete verification.


Qolo would verify the identity of the Person through data collected, but may also request for documentary evidence or additional information. [API reference](https://devdocs.qolopay.com/openapi/qoloreference/operation/PerformKYC)
